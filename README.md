# Y10-Design-Visualization
This project, visualizes the secondary enrollment in different countries with different incomes since 1970 to 2020 as a growing tree.

# Raw Data:
1. API_SE.SEC.ENRR_DS2_en_csv_v2_4672725.csv: Secondary School Enrollment Rate(%), by country by year, from 1960 to 2021. (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2022)
2. API_SP.POP.0014.TO_DS2_en_csv_v2_4661114.csv: Population Ages 0~14 (%), by country by year, from 1960 to 2021 (The World Bank, 2019)
3. Countries-Continents.csv: Classification of Country by Continents (World Population Review, 2022)
4. Metadata_Country_API_SE.SEC.ENRR_DS2_en_csv_v2_4672725.csv: Classification of Country by Income (UNESCO Institute for Statistics, 2022)
5. Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.0014.TO_DS2_en_csv_v2_4661114.csv: Same as 5
6. gdp-per-capita-maddison-2020.csv: Gdp per capita by country by year (World Bank, 2022)

Note: File 5 and File 3 are not used in the code, but they are crucial to future improvements.

# Code:
There are two different versions of codes (Tree_Income.py and Tree_Income_population.py). However, the key ideas are the same.
